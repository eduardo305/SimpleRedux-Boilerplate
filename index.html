    <h1>Redux Boilerplate</h1>
    <p>
      This boilerplate uses babel and webpack. To use it, simply clone the repo,
      run <b>npm install</b> followed by the command <b>webpack -d</b>. Finally,
      just open the index.html in your favorite browser.

      Branches:
        - master: has a very simple version using redux-promise middleware
        - redux-thunk-version: has a version that uses redux-thunk middleware.
        It demonstrates the power and flexibility of redux-thunk over redux-promise
        by giving the hability of rendering API errors

      <b>Please openup your best devtools inspector in order to see the results.</b>
