    <h1>Redux Boilerplate with Redux-Thunk</h1>
    <p>
      This example makes use of <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk" _target=blank>redux-thunk</a>
      in order to fetch users and handle error scenarios properly. In our case
      we are simply loggin the state changes along with the object returned or
      the error message in case of request failure.

      Please openup your best devtools inspector.
